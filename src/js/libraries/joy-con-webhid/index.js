 * Connects to a HID device and initializes it as a Joy-Con controller or general controller.
 *
 * This function identifies the device type based on its product ID and creates the appropriate
 * controller instance. It then opens the device connection and enables various controller modes

 *
 * @param device - The HID device to connect to
 * @returns A Promise that resolves to the connected and configured controller instance
 *
 * @remarks
 * - Product ID 0x2006 is identified as a Joy-Con Left controller
 * - Product ID 0x2007 with product name "Joy-Con (R)" is identified as a Joy-Con Right controller
 * - All other devices are treated as general controllers
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const hidDevice = await navigator.hid.requestDevice({
 *   filters: [{ vendorId: 0x057e }]
 * });
 * const controller = await connectDevice(hidDevice);
